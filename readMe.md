## Reddit Age Predicter

### How does it work
I am using [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to parse through subreddits.
Currently, this looks at a subreddit and depending on user input, ends up writing comments from users of that subreddit's posts to a csv file (read the Scraping methods folder for more info). In the future it will be way more flexible. 
###Why did I build this
In particular, I am currently using this for a project that will guess the generation/age of a redditor based off one comment, using machine learning and natural language processing.
However, I've had a lot of fun making this and wanna create a full fleged scraper!
