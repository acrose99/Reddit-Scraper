## Data Scraping:

1. For each subreddit, scrape the top 50 submissions and save as an array. 
2. For each submission, scrape the top 50 comments (if less then 50 exist, scrape them all)
    * For each comment, save the user’s username and apikey
3. For each username, save the user’s most 50 recent comments 
4. Write each comment to a csv file
    * Save the comment, and the subreddit for labeled data.
