21,"The link is about binary files that dude is going to **attach to the code that is already under git**.

> why use another way when you have a perfect solution already

So this is not the relevant case. You are not attaching the binary files to anything that is already in the git, you are doing it all from scratch -- from the point where you should better look for other options. I believe there are plenty of websites for hosting and sharing videogame maps. The only ""profit"" you are going to have by storing it on Github/Gitlab instead of Google Drive is automatic README markdown rendering -- just for a collage?..

You have to enable ReLive, Region Recording Hotkey, Borderless Region Capture there AND the Show Overlay in the main drivers settings tab. Then when you use the Region Recording Hotkey it shows the overlay where you chose the Red Alert 2 and it starts recording. Weird thing is that the recorded file has your screen resolution even while the window was smaller.

Now the Windows Magnifier -- since my RA2.ini settings are the screen resolution divided by 2, I move the game window to the corner of the screen with `Win Right`, `Win Down` keys. It breaks the size of the window so I `alt tab` to unstick the mouse from the game and drag the left top corner of the game window to restore the correct window size. This procedure positions the window right in the bottom right corner of your screen so now when you move the mouse there and press `Win +` several times it zooms perfectly to the borders of the game window. Also disable the ""follow mouse"" in the Magnifier settings.

The only issue I might face is that Steam and Windows Notifications appear in that corner so maybe for the game I'll have to move the Windows Taskbar from the left border of the screen to the right one and place the game at the bottom left.

---

Later I'll use the Avidemux software to crop the start and the end of this recording. There you should cut by keyframes and not change the encoding so it will not harm the quality and crop it quickly. I'm yet to think up what things to record since I've found there are already pretty cool speedruns that I can't beat.
