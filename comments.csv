4,"A few years back, I bought my nieces the DVD set.  The teens rolled their eyes and said it was okay.  The 10 year old pulled me aside, ""Don't listen to them. We stayed up all night watching it.  I loved it.  Get me more. . . ""  I had to break it to her that was it. Really loved that show.",/r/GenX,What we need to complete our quarantine is a My So-Called Life marathon.

7,"Whatever happened to training wheels?  Let Tru build confidence with some training wheels.  Baby steps!  Riding a bike involves confidence.  If you're skittish, you fall over.  If she's comfortable, she'll do much better.  Let her ride with training wheels until she decides she's ready.  Kody was pushing her too much.",/r/GenX,Just wanted to post this iconic quote by Truely for anyone that needs it.,RouxMaux

11,"I wasn't a fan of either of them.  But the last season, Jon just looked so shell shocked in their couch sessions, it was almost comical.  He had this ""deer in the headlights"" look at all times.  It was like, ""Jon!  Blink 4 times if you want us to send help!""",/r/GenX,Am I being dramatic about this past episode?,RouxMaux
12,"I liked that the internet was very limited.  You had email, which was amazing the first time I used it.  You could print out maps off Mapquest.  You could chat with randos on AOL (A/S/L?).  There were message boards where you could post on various topics.   It was all harmless fun and no one was obsessed with it.  At best, people had a huge home computer, not a tiny computer in their pocket, taking up all their time.  It basically was a handy tool that would take up a few minutes of your day.",/r/GenX,What do you miss about the 90s?,RouxMaux
13,"Their own businesses are the cliched Utah women ""businesses"", MLM scams.  Granted, they do well with them because they have a far reach with television fans.

15,"Janelle doesn't have a degree.   None of the sister wives have any degrees. Why do we keep giving them more credit for education on here than they deserve?  Last week, it was said Meri had a Masters in Social Work.  No.  Please.  These ladies got married to pop out babies and get into heaven.  Education was the last thing on their mind.  That being said, I think Janelle is intelligent and pragmatic and wouldn't need Kody.",/r/GenX,Do I like Janelle or not?,RouxMaux
16,"Absolutely.  And it tends to decimate towns.  Jobs lost.  Houses for sale.  Less buyers because an entire corporation packed up and left town.  Small businesses, like restaurants, that counted on the corporation's patronage for lunch and catering, go out of business.  The town suddenly doesn't look so appealing with a giant empty corporation with a ""for sale"" sign and numerous expensive houses on the market and all the local restaurants closed.  Montvale is unrecognizable from what it was in the late `80s.  It's truly a shame.",/r/GenX,North Jersey multi-million-dollar homes linger on the market for years,RouxMaux
17,"I agree.  North Jersey doesn't have the job opportunities it did 20 years ago.  Montvale, NJ was a corporation-mecca, years ago.  Now it's practically a ghost town.

21,"I also did well asking for ""Florist's Choice.""   Told them to pick what was fresh.  They made a spectacular arrangement with yellow roses for my Mom for Valentine's Day.  Let's face it, yellow roses aren't romantic.  But perfect for Mom.",/r/GenX,"LPT: When ordering flowers for Valentine's Day, call a local florist. Also, if they have a website with the arrangements, do not mention the arrangement by name -- describe it. They will almost certainly just charge you the same overpriced amount as the online version if you reference by name.",RouxMaux
22,"In 1985, I saw Yul Brynner perform in The King and I.  The man had been given a death sentence of terminal cancer.  Basically, he was doing these performances as his ""swan song.""  He was on stage, performing his heart out.  When he performed Shall We Dance?, the whole audience was on their feet at the end.  There wasn't a dry eye in the house when he came to take his final bow.",/r/GenX,What‚Äôs the most emotional moment you‚Äôve ever seen onstage?,RouxMaux

29,"The thing you're not giving JD credit for, is his work ethic.  As Howard has said, he does everything he is told, quickly and without complaint.  Shows up every day on time.  He also knows his limitations.  Without the show, he's fucked.  He knows that.  He's no Steve Grillo.  He won't storm out of there, certain of his fame and fortune elsewhere.  He will stay until Howard retires.  Then he's fucked.",/r/GenX,Did anyone hear Robin giving it to JD?,RouxMaux
